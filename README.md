# Stock Portfolio Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview
This project is designed to perform a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast the performance of a stock portfolio. It integrates a React front end for input handling, a Node.js backend to interact with a SQL database, and a C++ application for running the computationally intensive simulation in a multithreaded environment.

## How It Works

### Frontend
The React frontend allows users to input stock information, such as the name, the amount invested, and other relevant data. This information is then sent to the Node.js backend via HTTP requests (typically POST).

### Backend
The Node.js backend receives the stock data from the frontend and inserts it into a MySQL database. The backend serves as an API provider that the frontend consumes, and it also communicates with the C++ application to trigger the simulation.

### Database
MySQL database stores stock data provided by the user through the React frontend. The schema includes tables necessary to hold stock names, amounts, colors, and other attributes that may be needed for the simulation.

### C++ Monte Carlo Simulation
The C++ application is responsible for fetching the stock data from the MySQL database and running a Monte Carlo simulation. This process is multithreaded, meaning that it's capable of utilizing multiple CPU cores to improve performance and speed up computation. The simulation predicts the portfolio's performance over time and outputs the results to a CSV file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL Server
- C++ Compiler that supports C++11 (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- MySQL Connector/C++ for database integration

### Installation
1. Set up the MySQL database and create the required tables.
2. Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Compile the C++ Monte Carlo simulation application.

### Usage
1. Start the backend server.
2. Run the React frontend and input stock data.
3. Access the output CSV file generated by the C++ application to view the simulation results.
