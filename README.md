# Monte-Carlo-Portfolio-Analysis
This project is designed to perform a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast the performance of a stock portfolio. It integrates a React front end for input handling, a Node.js backend to interact with a SQL database, and a C++ application for running the computationally intensive simulation in a multithreaded environment.
